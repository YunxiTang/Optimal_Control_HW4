    "To get a good answer out of shooting methods like iLQR that rely on a dynamically feasible initial guess, it's often a good idea to find some sort of \"stable\" initial trajectory. For this problem, we'll simply find the \"trim\" conditions for level flight, or the controls need to maintain level flight with zero acceleration. In principle, this is going to be very similar to the problem in the HW1 where we found the equilibrium state for the quadruped, except that here we're only constraining the accelerations (not velocities) to be zero.\n",

In our case, this will be level flight with a forward velocity along the x-axis of 5 m/s. $f_\\text{accel}$ is a function that returns the linear and angular accelerations. You can just pull these out of a call to the continuous-time dynamics function."
